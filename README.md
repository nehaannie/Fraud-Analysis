Fraud Detection System
Introduction
This project aims to develop a fraud detection system that identifies fraudulent transactions based on historical data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system can predict whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent, helping financial institutions and businesses mitigate potential risks.

Project Overview
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features that describe transaction behavior.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on transaction patterns and historical data.
Model Training: Using algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Data
Dataset
Source: [Dataset Link] (If applicable)
Description: The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, transaction frequency, account age, and more. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent.
Key Features Used
transaction_amount: The amount involved in the transaction.
transaction_frequency: Number of transactions made in a certain time frame.
location_distance: Geographical distance between transaction location and customerâ€™s usual location.
account_age: The age of the account in days.
payment_method_change: Indicator if the payment method was recently changed.
device_type: Type of device used for the transaction.
ip_address: IP address used during the transaction.
customer_behavior: Historical behavior patterns of the customer.
Models and Techniques
1. Random Forest Classifier
Description: A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Usage: Trained on the dataset to predict fraudulent transactions.
2. Decision Tree Classifier
Description: A simple model that splits data into branches to make predictions based on decision rules.
Usage: Provided insights into feature importance for fraud detection.
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
Description: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming normal distribution of features.
Usage: Applied for its efficiency in handling large datasets.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The percentage of correctly predicted transactions.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted fraudulent transactions to all predicted fraudulent transactions.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted fraudulent transactions to all actual fraudulent transactions.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
ROC-AUC: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, making it the most effective model for this dataset. Feature importance analysis revealed that transaction amount, location distance, and payment method change were among the top predictors of fraud.

Future Work
Feature Expansion: Incorporating additional features such as customer demographics and transaction metadata.
Model Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters to further improve model performance.
Real-time Detection: Implementing the model in a real-time environment to detect fraud as transactions occur.
